title: "(Optional) Bypassing Booking Page Authentication"

## Default Behavior

The Gordian Whitelabel protects a consumer PII by creating a booking confirmation page that validates if the passenger has a valid PNR and last name for accessing a particular session. This works well for email marketing campaigns where it is often expected to access a booking that pnr and last name is necessary.

## Bypassing Authentication Page

For other use cases such as using a link for booking management, this disrupts the flow of the consumer experience and the look and feel of the website. For these cases, we offer booking page authentication bypass where the partner can pre authenticate a link before redirecting users to it.

### Getting JWT tokens to pre-authenticate session

We recommend calling this endpoint to be triggered on the event of a button click or on the load of page. The first step is to make a request to **POST** `authorize/<session_id_encoded>` with the following request body.

JSON

`{
    "pnr": "pqqdpo",
    "lastname": "halwa"
}
`

This will return the following response if valid

JSON

`{
  	"status": "authenticated",
    "access_token": "access-token",
    "refresh_token": "refresh-token"
}
`

if invalid, then a 401 response will occur.

### Attaching JWT Token to URL

Once the JWT token is known, then pass it as query param, named **access\_token**, in the url to bypass the booking page

An example of this is the following is

`{{base_url}}/ancillaries/{{encoded_session_id}}?access_token={{access_token}}
`
