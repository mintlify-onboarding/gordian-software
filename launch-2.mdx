After confirmation of the integration, the Gordian team will issue production credentials. The teams will agree on a launch date with a portion of traffic and will schedule a call with members of both teams to monitor the initial release.

Following the launch, we will monitor incoming traffic and provide updates in the shared Slack channel.
