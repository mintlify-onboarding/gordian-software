### API Flow

#### 1\. Create a trip

> ðŸ“˜
> 
> The first step of a customer journey is to create a [trip](/reference.html#tag/Trip). The Trip is the main entity that helps you keep track of all the information needed to modify the reservation in any way.

When creating a trip, you receive a `trip_id` which is the trip identifier to use for the rest of the customer journey.

---

#### 2\. Build a trip

Once youâ€™ve created a trip and received the `trip_id`, you can enable the customer to build the trip according to their needs. To build a trip, the customers follow these steps:

1. Search for flights or ancillaries
2. Add products to the Basket
3. Verify the basket items

Customers can go back and redo the steps freely to build the trip as they need.

---

#### 3\. Fulfill a trip

When the customer approves the items in the basket, you can start the fulfillment process.Fulfilling a trip is a 2-step process:

1. Initiate the fulfillment process.
2. Check fulfillment status.

---

#### 4\. Service a trip (post-sale)

Gordian supports post sale changes and cancellations to products booked through Gordian.
