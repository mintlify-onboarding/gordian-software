title: "Create Session From Trip"
---

For partners that already have an integration with Gordian's Core API, integrating White Label's postbooking session is very simple! If you already have a Gordian Trip created and have an accompanying trip\_id for the trip for which you wish to add ancillaries post-booking with White Label, you need not provide the itinerary and passenger details again! You can simply pass us the `trip_id` and we will do the rest!

To create a session using this method, a post request is to be made to the following endpoint:  
`POST REQUEST` `https://whitelabel.gordiansoftware.com/post-booking-session/trip/<trip_id>`

> 📘
> 
> Authentication
> 
> Authentication uses Basic Auth Format with the provided API key as username and an empty password

We will initially provide a sandbox API key for you to be able to test our endpoints. When using this sandbox API key, entire End-to-End fulfillment tests can be performed without actual fulfillment of ancillaries. Production API key will only be given after successful integration of White Label. Check the following [Integration Protocol documentation](https://www.notion.so/Integration-Protocol-da99ac74755c4b96ac6c4dcb5e0e9d0b) for more information: 

### URL Params

`/post-booking-session/trip/<trip_id>`

1. `trip_id` : The trip\_id of the trip for which you wish to add ancillaries post-booking `required`

### Request Body

We require the following information to be present in the request body under the indicated keys:

1. `partner_url_id` : The Partner\_url\_id that helps us identify where this request is coming from `required`
2. `booking_id` : An unique id that can help you differentiate between the different bookings you manage `optional`

> 📘
> 
> Booking\_id
> 
> If provided, the resultant session\_id is a function of the partner\_id that we provide you and the booking\_id (See below for more information). This saves you the hassle of having to manage another session\_id in your databases.

### Sample Request Body:

JavaScript

`    {
	"partner_url_id": "b5b978d7-19ab-4638-b596-f5cef08a1433", 
	"booking_id": "123456789ff1"	
}
`

### Sample Response:

If done correctly, calling this endpoint will return the following data:

`{
	"url": "https://gordian-ancillaries-white-label.netlify.app/ancillaries/<BASE64_encoded_session_id>"
}
`

The `BASE64_encoded_session_id` appended to the back of the base URL can be decoded to obtain the session id corresponding to the particular trip in question.  
Below we have the python code example to specify how to do that.

`import base64

def base64_decode(data: str):
    return base64.urlsafe_b64decode(bytes(data, "utf-8")).decode("utf-8")
`

The decoded session\_id will then take on the following form:

* if a booking id was provided:  
   * session_id = {partner\_id}_{booking\_id}
* if a booking id was not provided:  
   * session_id = {partner\_id}_{GORDIAN\_UUID}

As an example, if the `partner_id` we provided you with is : `a77da86a-d70e-42a2-83b8-2358f4d7e1c3`  
and you provided us with a booking\_id of `12345678`, the resultant session\_id is `a77da86a-d70e-42a2-83b8-2358f4d7e1c3_12345678`

> ❗️
> 
> Encoded url\_safe encoded session\_id
> 
> We expect the session\_id to be encoded in the url safe base64 encoding scheme when making subsequent requests to other endpoints where the session\_id is required. An error will be thrown otherwise.
