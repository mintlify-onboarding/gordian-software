#### Delayed Ticketing Fulfillment

Gordian has a mechanism whereby you can still send ancillary fulfillment requests even if you delay the ticketing of a booking.

To do so, you send Gordian two fulfillment requests, one at the creation of the PNR and one at time of ticketing. At the time of PNR creation, send Gordian a fulfillment request with the parameter is\_ticketed = False. When the booking has been ticketed, send Gordian a second fulfillment request with the parameter is\_ticketed = true. 

Please note, attaching an ancillary to an un-ticketed booking is only possible if you have shared NDC or GDS credentials with Gordian. Availability also varies by airline. Given this, partners who have a system of delayed ticketing should expect a lower fulfillment success rate for ancillaries.
