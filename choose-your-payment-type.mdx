Gordian offers various payment types passed into the API as part of the [fulfill call](/reference/fulfill-1).

* _Gordian Settlement_ \- Gordian can purchase the product using its own Virtual Credit Card and send you an invoice which includes the base cost of the ancillary plus the Gordian commission. (**strongly recommended**)
* _BSP Cash_ \- Gordian can use your [BSP account](https://www.iata.org/en/services/finance/bsp/) to process payments. Gordian can only use BSP Cash as a payment method if Gordian is fulfilling using bridged GDS or NDC connections.
* _Card_ \- Gordian can support receiving an external credit card for a select number of airlines. (_This requires pre-configuration with your account manager and is **strongly advised against**._)

Note: The White Label handles payment out of the box so there is no payment decision that needs to be made. See more information on [White Label payments](payment-settlements)
