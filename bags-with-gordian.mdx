### Starting Tips

* You will need a Gordian `api_key` to follow along this guide. If you do not have one, please contact your Gordian Account Manager. If you do not have a Gordian Account Manager, please email [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4c3c2d3e3822293e0c2b233e28252d223f232a383b2d3e29622f2321) to quickly request a demo to get started.
* The Gordian API uses [HTTP Basic Auth header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic%5Faccess%5Fauthentication#Client%5Fside) with your API key as the username and a blank password (this means you do not need a password). You must use [HTTPS as the transport protocol](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/).  
 Most request libraries have the ability to send requests with basic auth. For example, curl uses the _`curl -u 'username:password'`_ flag.
* Follow along the implementation with on our online sandbox:  
üåê \[[https://codesandbox.io/p/github/gordiansoftware/dynamic\_upsell\_integration](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/gordiansoftware/dynamic%5Fupsell%5Fintegration))
* When setting up the booking flow and returning flights, we recommend using **Spirit Airlines**.
* For all API calls we provide examples but you can also reference them in our [Postman Collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/24187796/2s8YY9w7ND).
