#### Add to Basket

To check an ancillary and prepare it for purchase, put it in the basket. You have multiple ways to add ancillaries to the basket:

* [Add new products to the basket](/reference/add%5Fto%5Fbasket).
* [Replace the basket items with a new set of products](/reference/update%5Fbasket).
* [Replace the basket items of a certain product type with a new set of products](/reference/update%5Fbasket%5Ffor%5Fproduct%5Ftype).
* [Replace the basket items of a certain passenger with a new set of products](/reference/update%5Fbasket%5Ffor%5Fproduct%5Ftype%5Fpassenger).

Once an ancillary is in the basket, it has a validity tag that may be one of the following values:

* `checking`: Gordian is checking the ancillary. Continue to [poll the basket information](/reference/get%5Fbasket) for an updated state.
* `valid`: Gordian holds the ancillary to ensure it is available for your customer.
* `price_changed`: There has been a price change since the last time it was checked.
* `needs_check`: The date in `valid_until` has passed and the ancillary needs a check.
* `unavailable`: The ancillary is no longer available.
