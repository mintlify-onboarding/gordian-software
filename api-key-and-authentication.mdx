## API Key

Gordian controls access to airline information and processes through the Gordian API key. 

Once you have determined the product and integration you would like to start with, please contact your account manager for your API key. If you do not have an account manager, [request a demo](https://www.gordiansoftware.com/) 

> ðŸ“˜
> 
> Your API key carries many privileges, so be sure to keep it secure! Do not share your API key in publicly accessible areas such as client-side code, GitHub, and so forth.

---

## Authentication

Gordianâ€™s authentication and authorization options allow you to interact with the Gordian API securely. 

The Gordian API uses [HTTP Basic Auth header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic%5Faccess%5Fauthentication#Client%5Fside) with your API key as the username and a blank password, that is, you do _not_ need a password. You must use HTTPS as the transport protocol.

Most request libraries have the ability to send requests with basic auth. For example, curl uses the `curl -u 'username:password'` flag.

> Gordian's Sandbox and Production Environments
> 
> Gordian's API has both a sandbox and production environment. The sandbox is equivalent to production environment except that it does not have permission to conduct a fulfillment request.

### Creating a trip

Creating a trip is the first step to using the API. Gordian provides two paths to create trips. You can select the path best suited to your implementation:

* [Direct trip creation](#direct-trip-creation): For architectures that handle trips creation in the backend and are capable of backend-to-backend communication.
* [Indirect trip creation](#indirect-trip-creation): For architectures that require your frontend application to handle trip creation and require frontend-to-backend communication.

> If you are using the Gordian widget, you would use [indirect trip creation](#indirect-trip-creation)

#### Direct trip creation

To create a trip directly, follow these steps:

1. From your backend server, use the [POST /v2.2/trip](/reference.html#operation/create%5Ftrip) endpoint with your `api_key`.  
You receive two tokens to use in the subsequent steps of the customer journey: `trip_access_token` and `refresh_token`.

#### Indirect trip creation

To create a trip indirectly, follow these steps:

1. From your backend server, use the [POST /v2.2/authorize](/reference/authorizeClient) endpoint with your `api_key`. You receive one token: `trip_creation_token`.
2. From your backend server or frontend application, use the [POST /v2.2/trip](/reference/create%5Ftrip) endpoint with `trip_creation_token`. You receive two tokens to use in the following steps of the customer journey: `trip_access_token` and `refresh_token`.

### API key and Trip Access Token

After creating a trip, you get a JSON Web Token called `trip_access_token` as an alternative for authentication. The difference between this and the API key is as follows:

| Auth option         | Expiration                                 | Communication                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| API key             | Does not expire                            | backend-to-backend                         |
| trip\_access\_token | Requires [refreshing](#refreshing-a-token) | backend-to-backend and frontend-to-backend |

#### Refreshing a token

When creating a trip, you receive two tokens with different expiration times:

* `trip_access_token` â€“ 30 minutes since its creation time.
* `refresh_token` â€“ 45 minutes since its creation time.

To refresh the trip access token, use the [POST /v2.2/refresh\_token](/reference/refresh%5Ftrip%5Faccess%5Ftoken) endpoint.

### Which authentication to use?

With the trip created, you can implement the rest of the customer journey with a mix of authentication options. The following table lists which of the authentication options you can use in each of the actions of the customer journey.

| **Action**                                                                                                                    | api\_key | trip\_access\_token |
