title: "Receive Callbacks"
---

The next phase step is to set up callbacks so that you are notified when a booking is fulfilled or fails. Callbacks need to be set up only once, regardless of how many different Gordian services you end up integrating in your journey flow.

---

### Whitelist IPs

To facilitate callbacks, you'll need to configure your IP whitelist to allow calls from Gordian's services.

Please allow the following IP addresses:

* `54.225.138.8`
* `52.6.216.177`
* `52.7.148.215`
* `52.72.130.32`
* `54.193.225.146`

### Create Callback Subscription

After whitelisting the IPs, you can [create a callback subscription](/reference/create%5Fcallback%5Fsubscription)
