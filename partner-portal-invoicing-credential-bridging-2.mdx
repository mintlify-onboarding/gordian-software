title: "Partner Portal, Invoicing, Credential Bridging"
---

As you are completing the technical integration, the Gordian team will review the Gordian Partner Portal, invoicing, and credential bridging (as applicable) with you. 

---

#### Partner Portal

As the engineering team is completing the integration of Gordian’s API, the Gordian team will introduce you to the Gordian portal. The portal allows for different roles for your finance team, your customer care team, and your administrators. The portal will contain information including your organization’s invoices, bookings, and available content.

#### Invoicing

We will send you a template of the invoice we will send to you, so you can receive sign off from your finance team. We will need the email address to which we should send the invoices at the agreed cadence. 

---

#### Credential bridging

If as part of the integration, we will be bridging credentials with a GDS, we will work with you to start that process, such that from day one, everything can be configured using your PCC, if desired. 

Leveraging your PCCs allows us to automatically attach the ancillary, and thus eliminates any lag between when the user selects a seat and when we attempt to attach it.

Your account manager will advise on what information is needed and detailed next steps.
