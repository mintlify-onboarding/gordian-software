### Step 1: Create a trip with Gordian

All ancillary searches are linked to a `trip`, which represents a userâ€™s trip.

To create a trip and search for ancillaries, from your backend server, use the `https://api.gordiansoftware.com/v2.2/trip` endpoint with your `api_key`. More details below:

> This combines the [create a trip](/reference/create%5Ftrip) and [start a search request](/reference/create%5Fsearch) steps by using in the Gordian system and the [create trip call](/reference/create%5Ftrip) by using the `search` object in the [create trip call](/reference/create%5Ftrip).

 Use the markup field if you would like to set the markup. Gordian is able to configure the markup for you if you prefer.

> `Fare class`, `fare basis`, and `fare family` allow Gordian to retrieve the most accurate pricing and availability. Gordian _strongly recommends_ you provide them. If, however, you can't for any reason, you can input`null` to retrieve results.

### Step 2: Poll the Search Results

[Poll the search results](/reference/search) endpoint until you get ancillaries options.

The search results contain a complete list of the benefits, including a representation of the seat map so you can present all the prices to the customer.
