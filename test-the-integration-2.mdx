> The integration test is the last step before launch!

Following the successful integration of the Gordian API in a sandbox or cert environment, we will schedule a session for pre-launch end-to-end-testing with both teams. 

> 📘
> 
> Partners should design their systems in such a way that _E2E testing can be performed in sandbox or cert environments._

During testing, partners should perform the bookings themselves and should not use live customer bookings for testing. The partner should ensure that following the testing session, all test bookings (and ancillaries) are successfully voided with the airline.

The partner will complete several end-to-end bookings (testing both successful and failed fulfillments) and Gordian engineers will monitor the API calls.
